          <p>
            ValidateIt is a Project for my Blockchain & Cryptocurrencies Class
            under Prof. Jothi K. R. This page outlines a few aspects of the
            same. ValidateIt leverages the power of blockchain technology to
            provide secure and tamper-proof Certificate Verification and
            Creation services. <br />
            With ValidateIt, universities can easily create digital certificates
            that can be verified by anyone using blockchain technology. This
            ensures that the certificates are authentic and cannot be altered or
            tampered with in any way.

      <h3 class="text">AIM</h3>
      <p>
        Managing student transcripts is a painful and document-heavy process
        that incurs costs on educational institutions and locks students away
        from accessing, proving, and transferring their credits. Hence, the aim
        of this project is to create/build a data-centric system that issues
        digital transcripts via the W3C Verifiable Credential standard.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text">OBJECTIVE</h3>
      <p>
        To create such a blockchain system, we must briefly understand a few
        terminologies. As explained in the aim of the project, the need for this
        data centric system is to ensure tamper evident and efficient
        verification of student documents by authorised personnel. Instead of
        paper work, it will be easier to verify digital documents called
        Verifiable Credentials issued to students by their universities. Such a
        VC will help students prove specific rights depending on the issuer, ie,
        the university. For example, the university offers you a diploma in the
        form of this VC for your DID (decentralised identifier) as a student
        after viewing your national ID or some other legal document. This can be
        verified, the transaction will be stored on a public ledger and then
        signed by the private key of your universiity. The objective of the
        project is to create this public ledger to store information for
        everyone to independently verify the credentials.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text">SCOPE</h3>
      <p>
        The scope of this project starts with anyone from any domain and their
        university, and extends to valid employers and other educational
        institutes they wish to join in. In the above example, the student
        receives the VC from their university, goes to the employer who verifies
        it, and then considers the student for a job.
